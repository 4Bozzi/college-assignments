A dump of all of the projects I could find from my Computer Science classes Java/Android (back when I still wrote apps in Java) and C++ Cuda research.

Not all of the files in these directories were written by me, some of them were group projects and each author is called out at the top of the file. If no author is listed, assume they are mine.

There will be more files coming if I find the rest of them.
